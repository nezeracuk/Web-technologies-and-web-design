            <p>One day we decided to call up Pavlo and Vilen in Discord to talk and do a lab together about
                web-technologies, I wanted to create a website with cameras and started adding photos of my cameras and
                suddenly I got a brilliant idea! “What would happen if I made a website with Pavlo?” Pavlo laughed at
                the idea,
                but didn't take it seriously, so I started creating new versions of Pavlo one by one. At the defense of
                my lab work,
                the teacher laughed at my lab work and I realized that I was moving in the right direction. </p>
            <p><strong>(: That's how this website was created. :)</strong></p>
        </div>
